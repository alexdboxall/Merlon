Another OS I want to work on...

EOS - Operating System for Embedded Systems

Designed for embedded systems, e.g. a microbit or for a custom built FPGA computer.

- Doesn't use virtual memory
- Doesn't support usermode

It's basically just:

- Some Arch... functions for:
    - IRQ on/off
    - timer
    - keyboard
    - read/write disk sector
    - getting memory map
    - terminal out
- A heap memory manager (via memory map above)
- FATFS
- The C standard library
    - stdio: uses FATFS -> disk/terminal driver 
    - string
    - stdlib: malloc/free
    - and actually quite a lot more

Dunno if it will have multithreading or not. I'm thinking it probably can, it 
doesn't actually need that much support, and would allow for multiple 'applications'.

Also don't know if loading programs from disk will be done, or if everything is
executed in the kernel. Methinks it will all just be in the kernel, but who knows?

Depends how basic you want it. If you allow basic multithreading and loading programs from
disk, then it's just like, e.g. classic Mac OS with its DAs.

Design goal: 
    "the microbit can run it" (well maybe, it has no disk, keyboard or terminal)
    "your self PC can run it" (very much a design goal).

It can also be used as, e.g. a bootstrap system for a larger OS.

There are no externally loaded drivers or dynamic linking of any other sort,
so you can use link-time optimisations on the kernel.

It should be really small and fast. No VFS, just the 'disk' and 'terminal'.
